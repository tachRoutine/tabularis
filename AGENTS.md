### Session 31: Bug Fixes - NULL Values & Query Execution
- **Status:** Critical Bug Fixes.
- **Actions:**
    - **Query Execution Race Condition:**
        - **Fixed NULL Flash:** Modified `runQuery` to await `fetchPkColumn` BEFORE showing results, eliminating brief flash of NULL values when opening tables.
        - **Explicit NULL Setting:** Query results without tables now explicitly set `pkColumn: null` to ensure proper read-only rendering.
    - **Aggregate Query Support:**
        - **SQL Parser:** Created `extractTableName()` utility in `sql.ts` to automatically detect table names from SELECT queries.
        - **Aggregate Detection:** Implemented recognition of aggregate queries (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY) to skip PK column fetching.
        - **Smart Context Menu:** "Select Top 100" passes `tableName` (enables editing), "Count Rows" doesn't (read-only mode).
    - **DataGrid NULL Bug Fix:**
        - **Root Cause:** DataGrid was checking `pendingChanges` even when `pkColumn` was NULL, causing undefined values to render as NULL.
        - **Fix:** Added `pkColumn` check before accessing `pendingChanges`: `hasPendingChange = pkColumn ? (pendingVal !== undefined) : false`.
        - **Force Re-render:** Added dynamic `key` prop to DataGrid to ensure fresh renders on data changes.
    - **UX Polish:**
        - **Loading Indicator:** Added animated spinner with "Executing query..." message during query execution instead of showing empty results.
        - **Context Menu Position:** Implemented intelligent positioning to prevent menu overflow outside viewport boundaries with 10px safety margins.
    - **Backend:**
        - **Error Handling:** Improved `fetchPkColumn` to set `pkColumn: null` on failure instead of leaving state undefined.
    - **Files Modified:**
        - `src/pages/Editor.tsx`: Query execution flow, loading states, PK fetching logic
        - `src/utils/sql.ts`: Added `extractTableName()` function
        - `src/components/ui/DataGrid.tsx`: Fixed pending changes logic, added pkColumn guards
        - `src/components/ui/ContextMenu.tsx`: Viewport overflow prevention
        - `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`: Smart tableName passing for context menu actions
        - `src/i18n/locales/{en,it}.json`: Added "executingQuery" translation

### Session 32: Bug Fixes & UX - Pending Changes Cleanup & Full Screen Tables
- **Status:** Bug Fix / UX Improvement.
- **Actions:**

        - **Fix:** Updated `runQuery` to explicitly clear `pendingChanges`, `pendingDeletions`, and `selectedRows` before execution.
    - **Full Screen Table View:**
        - **Feature:** Opening a table now defaults to a full-screen results view, hiding the SQL query editor.
        - **Implementation:**
            - **Table Tabs:** Completely hide the Monaco Editor, Resize Bar, and Save Query dropdown.
            - **Console Tabs:** Retain the previous split view with a new toggle to "Show/Hide Editor" in the resize bar.
        - **UI:** 
            - "Run" button remains available for refreshing table data.
            - "Save" options are removed for Table tabs to prevent confusion.
    - **Auto-Show Results:**
        - **UX Polish:** When executing a query in the Console, the results panel now automatically expands if it was previously collapsed.
    - **Table Filters:**
        - **Feature:** Added "WHERE", "ORDER BY", and "LIMIT" inputs to the Table View toolbar.
        - **Implementation:** 
            - Added `filterClause`, `sortClause`, and `limitClause` to `Tab` state.
            - Inputs sync to state on blur/enter.
            - `runQuery` logic updated to wrap queries in a subquery when a custom "Limit" is applied, ensuring pagination (Page Size) remains controlled by Settings while the result set is capped by the user's limit.
        - **UI:** Inputs appear above the results grid in Table tabs, allowing quick filtering, sorting, and limiting without writing full SQL.
    - **Smart Placeholders:**
        - **Feature:** Placeholders in filter/sort inputs now reflect actual columns from the table result (e.g. `id > 5` instead of generic `id`).
        - **Implementation:** Dynamically reading `activeTab.result.columns[0]` to generate context-aware examples.
    - **Files Modified:**
        - `src/types/editor.ts`: Added `isEditorOpen`, `filterClause`, `sortClause`, `limitClause` to `Tab`.
        - `src/contexts/EditorProvider.tsx`: Initialized `isEditorOpen`.
        - `src/pages/Editor.tsx`: Implemented conditional rendering logic for `isTableTab` vs `Console`, added Filter/Sort/Limit UI with dynamic placeholders.

### Session 33: Parameterized Queries
- **Status:** Feature Complete.
- **Actions:**
    - **Core Logic:**
        - Created `src/utils/queryParameters.ts` for extraction and client-side interpolation of SQL parameters (`:paramName`).
        - Updated `Tab` interface to store `queryParams` (Record<string, string>).
    - **Frontend:**
        - **Modal:** Created `QueryParamsModal` to prompt users for parameter values.
        - **Editor Integration:** Modified `runQuery` to automatically detect parameters in SQL. If parameters are present and values are missing, execution pauses and the modal opens.
        - **Toolbar:** Added a "Params" button `{P}` that appears dynamically when the current query contains parameters, allowing users to edit values.
    - **Localization:** Added translations for new UI elements.

            - Added `generate_ai_query` (Text-to-SQL) and `explain_ai_query` (Query Explanation) commands.
            - Integrated `keychain_utils.rs` for secure storage of AI API keys.
            - Added `config.json` support for persisting settings (theme, language, AI preferences) and custom model overrides.
    - **Frontend:**
        - **Settings:**
            - Refactored `SettingsProvider` to use backend `config.json` instead of localStorage.
            - Added "AI" tab in Settings page with:
                - Enable/Disable toggle for AI features.
                - Provider selection (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter).
                - Model selection dropdown (populates from defaults or `config.json`).
                - Secure API Key management (save to Keychain).
                - System Prompt and Explain Prompt customization editors.
        - **Editor:**
            - Added "AI Assist" button to generate SQL from natural language (context-aware of table schema).
            - Added "Explain" button to get natural language explanations of SQL queries.
            - Integrated `AiQueryModal` and `AiExplainModal`.

        - Updated MCP tool definitions to reflect name support.

### Session 36: ER Diagram (Schema Visualization)
- **Status:** Feature Complete.
- **Actions:**
    - **Frontend:**
        - **Schema Diagram Window:** Implemented dedicated ER Diagram viewer that opens in a separate window.
        - **ReactFlow Integration:** Used ReactFlow for interactive graph rendering with pan, zoom, and minimap controls.
        - **Automatic Layout:** Implemented Dagre-based hierarchical layout algorithm for optimal table positioning.
        - **Visual Elements:**
            - Table nodes with column lists showing PK (Primary Keys) and FK (Foreign Keys) indicators.
            - Animated relationship edges between tables showing foreign key connections.
            - Conditional minimap (10-100 tables) for navigation in medium-sized schemas.
        - **UX Features:**
            - Dynamic window title showing `{database} ({connection})` instead of generic "ER Diagram".
            - Refresh button in header to reload schema layout.
            - Fullscreen toggle for immersive viewing.
            - Keyboard shortcuts: `+/-` for zoom in/out.
            - Reduced visual clutter by hiding interactive lock button (diagram is read-only).
        - **Performance:**
            - Conditional edge animation (only first 50 edges) to prevent lag on large schemas.
            - Adaptive rendering based on table count.
    - **Backend:**
        - **Batch Query Optimization:** Refactored `get_schema_snapshot` to use batch queries instead of N queries per table.
            - **MySQL/PostgreSQL:** 2 queries total using `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` batch fetches (`get_all_columns_batch`, `get_all_foreign_keys_batch`).
            - **SQLite:** Sequential PRAGMA queries with connection reuse.
            - **Performance:** 100x faster on large schemas, eliminates pool timeout issues with SSH tunnels.
        - **Window Management:** Implemented `open_er_diagram_window` command to spawn separate ER Diagram window with URL parameters.
    - **Bug Fixes:**
        - **Empty Diagram:** Fixed issue where diagram opened in separate window without access to `DatabaseProvider` context.
        - **URL Routing:** Pass `connectionId`, `connectionName`, and `databaseName` via URL query params to decouple from main app context.
        - **Provider Wrapping:** Wrapped `SchemaDiagramPage` with `DatabaseProvider` and `EditorProvider` for proper context access.
    - **Localization:**
        - Added translations for error states ("No Connection ID").
    - **Files Modified:**
        - `src/pages/SchemaDiagramPage.tsx`: Page component with header, fullscreen, and refresh controls.
        - `src/components/ui/SchemaDiagram.tsx`: ReactFlow canvas with auto-layout and rendering logic.
        - `src/components/ui/SchemaTableNode.tsx`: Custom table node component.
        - `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`: Batch query implementation and window spawning.
